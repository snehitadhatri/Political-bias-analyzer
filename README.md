# AI-Based Text Political Bias Detection
Technologies: TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, Machine Learning, NLP, Python

Developed a machine learning-based Python text classification system to identify political bias in textual data. Work included:

Goal: Created an automated system that detects and classifies political bias in text.

Preprocessing Data: Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods like cleaning of text, tokenization, and lemmatization for normalization of input data.

Feature Engineering: Applied TF-IDF vectorization to transform text data into numerical features to train the model.

Model Development: Developed a Logistic Regression classifier to examine and classify political bias in text.

Evaluation Metrics: Evaluated the performance of the model using accuracy scores, classification reports, confusion matrices, and cross-validation strategies.

Dataset: Used a labeled dataset (Political_Bias.csv) with text samples and corresponding bias labels.

Impact: The model can be used to predict political bias in text, helping researchers, journalists, and analysts identify trends in political bias in discourse.

This project reflects proficiency in NLP, text classification, and bias detection, and demonstrates good analytical and machine learning skills.
